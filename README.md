# NYC Property Sales
This analysis aims to answer the questions below using the [NYC Citywide Annualized Calendar Sales Update](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Citywide-Annualized-Calendar-Sales-Update/w2pb-icbu/about_data) dataset.

*  How accurately can one predict price using - gross sq. ft. & year built?
* Can the following features be used to identify in which borough a property sits: sale price, building class category, tax class at time of sale, and year built?

The dataset includes yearly sales information of properties sold in New York City from 2016-2022, and was last updated in July 2023 at the time of this analysis.

## The project contains the following files:

*  [NYC Property Sales - Python Notebook](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/NYC-Property-Sales/blob/main/NYC_Property_Sales.ipynb) - EDA, Data Cleaning, Visualizations, Model Selection and Training
*  [NYC Property Sales ML Model Testing](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/NYC-Property-Sales/blob/main/NYC_Property_Sales_ML_model_Testing.ipynb) - tests selected models using sample records
*  [The Decision Tree Classifier Model](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/NYC-Property-Sales/blob/main/NYC_DecisionTreeClassifier().pkl) - The files for the other models are too big to include in this repo
